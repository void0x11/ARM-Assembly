## Microprocessor Class Labs and Final Project
This repository contains the laboratory exercises and final project for the EE-3780 Microprocessor Systems class, Fall 2024. The coursework is based on the ARM Cortex-M4 architecture (STM32F411) and follows the reference text ARM Assembly Language: Fundamentals and Techniques, Second Edition by William Hohl and Christopher Hinds. It covers essential topics such as assembly programming, memory management, peripheral interfacing, and floating-point arithmetic.

## Overview
This repository serves as a record of the structured labs and final project completed during the Microprocessor class. It highlights key concepts such as ARM assembly programming, memory management, peripheral interfacing, and advanced processor features.
